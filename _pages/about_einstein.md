I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics (Aix-Marseille University) since September 2020 under the supervision of Cl√©ment Bosquet and Federico Trionfetti.
I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of economic history, political economy, and urban economics. 
In the fall of 2023, I visited Boston University sponsored by James Feigenbaum, Martin Fiszbein and Benjamin Marx.
