**"Collective action and gender roles: evidence from suffragist demonstrations",  JMP**

**Abstract**: Can collective action drive transformations in social roles and attitudes?  I study the effect of local exposure to women's suffrage protests in the early 20th century in the US on different indicators of gender roles.  Enfranchisement was anticipated to enhance women's awareness, leading to a critical reevaluation of more traditional family structures, according to suffrage movement leaders. This study investigates whether raising awareness about one's rights, alongside obtaining them, can foster social transformations. I study cross-county marches organized between 1912 and 1914 by the suffragists, a group of women activists fighting for women's suffrage.  I build a novel historical database using local newspaper archives to map the itinerary of the marches. Using individual-level data from US censuses (1880-1930), I compare individual outcomes in towns along the suffragists' paths with those outside, both before and after the marches, within each county. Results suggest that exposure to suffragist demonstration led to (i) an increase for women in being reported as gainfully employed and to a decrease in being reported as housekeepers, (ii) a decrease in both marriage and fertility rates. Additionally, preliminary evidence from newspaper coverage suggests that women were likely exposed to suffragist ideas beyond the marches due to the relative growing interest in the topic in treated towns in the subsequent years.

**"Roads, education and employment: evidence from the US rural highways", with Clément Bosquet**

**Abstract**: We study education and employment responses to changes in local economic opportunities driven by transport infrastructure improvement. We exploit the timeline of the US highways construction in the mid-20th century to measure how rural individuals aged 14 and 15 (the age at which working is considered legal) respond to new economic opportunities triggered by highway connectivity. We combine US Census data from 1940 to 1970 with historical information on highway location and use an established instrumental variable to account for the non-random placement of highways. Preliminary results suggest that road connectivity negatively impacts education in favor of early participation in the labor market. This increase in employment is driven by youth starting to work as farm laborers in the agricultural sector, which has declined less rapidly over time in connected counties. Looking at 24- and 25-years old men, we show that these effects of an early connection to the highway network persist after 10 years.

**"Forbidden love: the impact of banning interracial marriages", with Björn Brey and Roberta Ziparo.**

**Abstract**: The majority of US states enacted anti-miscegenation laws at varying points during the 19th and 20th century. These laws made interracial marriages "prohibited and void'' making them a cornerstone policy of segregation. Exploiting variations in introduction and coverage we study how these laws shaped family structures and reinforced differences in economic outcomes across racial groups. To do this, we combined information on state-level anti-miscegenation laws with longitudinal data from the US censuses (1850-1940). This dataset allows us to follow more than 30 million men over time. Our preliminary results suggest that the implementation of anti-miscegenation laws changed the composition of marriages and increased out-of-state migration of individuals targeted by the laws, in particular individuals in mixed marriages, but also Black men overall. Moreover, codifying race was a key necessity to enforce interracial marriage bans so that miscegenation laws included the blood purity rules. In line with this, we find that racial identity changes of initially Black individuals, a non-negligible phenomenon, declined when miscegenation laws were introduced. Further preliminary explorations suggest that this also had an impact on keeping an exploitative agricultural economic model in place.
