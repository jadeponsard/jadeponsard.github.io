I am a postdoctoral scholar at <a href="https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/" target="_blank">**ENS de Lyon**</a> in the Department of Economics and the <a href=" https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/" target="_blank"> Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict (CERGIC)</a>.


I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of **economic history**, **political economy**, and **urban economics**.

In the fall of 2025, I will be visiting the Applied Micro team at Queen Mary University (London), hosted by Sebastian Axbard.

I defended my PhD at <a href=" https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en" target="_blank">Aix-Marseille School of Economics</a> in November 2024.

You can find my **CV** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJHmK3pp34EM_TPcJ_FNU2bA-oa1M2v_/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">here</a>.
