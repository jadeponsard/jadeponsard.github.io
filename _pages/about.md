I am a Ph.D. candidate at the `Aix-Marseille School of Economics` (Aix-Marseille University) since September 2020 under the supervision of `Cl√©ment Bosquet` and `Federico Trionfetti`. 

I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of economic history, political economy, and urban economics. 

In the fall of 2023, I visited Boston University sponsored by `James Feigenbaum`, `Martin Fiszbein` and `Benjamin Marx`.

In septembre 2024, I will be joining `ENS de Lyon` as a postdoctoral scholar.

You can find my CV `here`.
